## Introduction

This project tracks the process of identifying and solving hydration issues for Pierre, a persona based on interviews with runners. It includes interviews, ideation sessions, and a storyboard that visualizes the solution using a `wearable hydration monitoring device` to remind Pierre to stay hydrated during his races.

## Process Overview
### 1. Interviews

The project began with `interviews` that explored runners' hydration habits and challenges. Key insights were gathered from:

* **William (33)**: Struggles with staying hydrated during intense races.
* **Nathan (39)**: Balances hydration but faces challenges during long runs.
* **Joe (30)**: Finds it difficult to manage hydration in hot climates.
* **Guillemette (31)**: Focuses on hydration post-workout and emphasizes gradual race training.

These interviews helped identify hydration management during races as a critical pain point.

### 2. Persona Creation: Pierre

From the interviews, **Pierre** was developed as a persona:

* **Age:** 32
* **Challenge:** Managing hydration during long races.
* **Goal:** To run without getting dehydrated.
* **Frustrations:** Struggles to maintain hydration without constant reminders.

### 3. Problem Statement
Based on Pierre’s challenges, the following problem statement was created:

* `How might we help Pierre measure and prepare his hydration before a race?`

### 4. Ideation
An `ideation` session was conducted to brainstorm solutions to Pierre's problem. Creative constraints such as Pierre being blind, late, clumsy, or even a billionaire helped explore a variety of possible solutions. The selected solution was:

* **A wearable hydration monitoring device** that tracks hydration levels and alerts Pierre when it’s time to drink water.

### 5. Storyboard
A `storyboard` was drawn to illustrate Pierre's experience with the solution. The six steps include:

1. **Pierre wears the device before the race.**
2. **The device monitors his hydration levels during the race.**
3. **It alerts him when he needs to hydrate.**
4. **Pierre takes a drink based on the alert.**
5. **The device tracks hydration throughout the race.**
6. **Post-race, the device provides feedback on hydration levels.**
